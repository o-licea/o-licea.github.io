                <h3>Learning 日本語, 6 Month Progress Update

                For anyone curious enough to read this, welcome! This is just a small update, mainly meant for
                myself to look back onto and reference in the future. If you really want to, feel free to have
                a read. I did make this public, after all.
            </p> <br>

				Looking back on what I've been doing since I started, I really don't understand why I even 
				decided to pursue this route in the first place. It's not like I regret what I've managed to 
				accomplish, but pursing this route proved to be way harder than I could have ever really imagined.
                I naively thought that somehow, after learning a few words in Japanese, I would be able to have 
                the same amount of comprehension that I would normally have watching something with an audio dub or 
                reading the subtitles. That guy in the past must be an <b>idiot</b> for thinking such silly thoughts, I 
                can't believe I'm even related to him....
            </p>

            <p>
                Even though it started off as such a simple goal, I decided that I wanted to take my time and still
                learn the language. Even now, I still feel like I'm not close to where I would like to be, like the 
                amount of time that I would have to sink in to get to a somewhat intermediate level is far from my
                reach. With that being said, the fruits that I have nurtured since March 24th have slowly started to
                blossom:

            <i><b><br>Total amount of words I've learned after 177 days of consistent study via Anki/Cultural Immersion.</b></i>

            <p>
                In total, I've managed to learn 1,500 words in the span of around 6 months. Those minimal amount of 
                words have only contributed towards me being able to learn the language at a very elementary level. 
                Having to learn all of the different Kanji used for vocabulary while trying to memorize words is 
                very challenging. It is so easy to just misinterpret a word just because you remembered it wrong and
                <i>poof</i>, the idea the sentence is trying to convey can make no sense at all. I miss complaining 
                about how the spelling for 'Wednesday' makes absolutely no sense at all when I was in Elementary 
                School instead of looking at these ancient scribbles and wanting to bash my head against the wall 
                for 500 hours. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Surprisingly, I have been very consistent on maintaining this habit since I really started taking my
                learning seriously. I took a 4-month break when I first started, so <i>please</i> ignore the 66% days learned
                statistic from the heatmap. If I had never taken that break, I wonder at what level I would be at now.
                Or rather, would I have even bothered after a while of learning to continue at the pace that I currently
                have? It doesn't really matter now, so I guess I could just move forward without thinking about it?
                Maybe? 
            </p>

            <p>
                Anyways, I am still satisfied by the results that I have managed to pull off. It turns out that simply
                learning a bunch of vocabulary and watching a bunch of anime with the JP subs <i>can</i> actually be
                a useful tool for learning the language. Of course, there is way more that goes into it than that, but 
                I do understand some of the sentences and lines that get repeated when I understand the words in them.
                Sometimes. Other times I have to do a word lookup and even then I don't even understand the meaning of 
                the sentence. It has gotten way easier over time though, the first month was so torturous using an
                immersion-based learning method because it sounded like <i>blah blah blah, konnichiwa, blah, blah</i> . 
                I am so glad that now it sounds like <i>konnichiwa, konnichiwa, blah, desu.</i> Yay, what an improvement!
            </p>

            <p>
                In all honesty, I am incredibly surprised on how effective this method as actually worked out for me. 
                Imagine telling someone that simply learing a couple thousand of Japanese words and constantly surrounding
                yourself with the language can be enough for a person to pick up on it. It sounds like it would never 
                work in theory, but in practice it is a very effective tool. From going to understanding absolutely 
                nothing to a level where I can somewhat keep up with what the dialogue being spoken is trying to 
                communicate, I have even surprised myself with the results. I'm terrified of the person that will be one
                year into the learning process, that guy will probably end up being a <b>monster</b>. I'll probably update
                with another update when I feel like it, but I don't really have anything more to add. I guess to the me 
                in the future, good luck? You probably don't need me to tell you that, though...
